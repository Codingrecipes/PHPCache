If you have a dynamic website, written in PHP and your site is slow then this solution might help you.
Some times you have to have some nasty query then process the result afterwards which makes the whole thing even nastier and slow.
With PHPCache, you will be able to cache the result of that piece of code for as long as you want.
Suppose that your nasty script gets 100 hits per second, and you cache your script using PHPCache for just 1 minute at a time, the result is, in that one minute your server will run that piece of code only once.
PHPCache will only query the database for the result that was stored in the database 100 times in that one minute.
This will be a very quick process, since it’s only a primary key lookup (piece a cake) for MySQL and SQLite. These databases can handle 1000s of simple queries like these per second! But your server might only be able to process your code 5 times per second…
In fact I tested this and SQLite could retrieve the cache 2,300 per second, MySQL around 2,500 times!
PHPCache supports MySQL, MySQLi and SQLite extensions at this time but you are welcome to write and submit extensions for other database servers.
The other great thing about PHPCache is support for SQLite; SQLite is a very nice, quick little database that you can setup easily and you won’t need to have MySQL.
